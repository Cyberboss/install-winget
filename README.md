# install-winget

Action to install [winget-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) default v1.8.1911 on Windows runners. Other versions can be installed by changing `wget_release_id` parameter.

Currently only supports `windows-2022` runner image.

# DEPRECATION NOTICE

The `windows-2025` GitHub actions runner image now comes preinstalled with `winget`. If the version packaged needs to be upgraded, it can be done with the following command.

```
winget upgrade winget --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements --disable-interactivity
```

This action will continue to work in its previous capacity on `windows-2022` images. `windows-2025` will not be supported.

Thank you a so much for using my crappy hack action.

#### `wget_release_id` (Optional)

This is used to be able to pin (make immutable) the version of winget that is taken github. To see which versions (you need the release-id) is possible to use plese check the github API for the release of [winget-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) this can be checked by looking for the topmost `id:` attribute here: https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/winget-cli/releases .

```yml
    - uses: Cyberboss/install-winget@v1
      id: stepid
